## Introduction

Quicksort, though highly efficient in average-case scenarios, can be bottlenecked with large datasets. This project parallelizes the Quicksort algorithm with MPI and employs an optimal median-based pivot selection to enhance its performance, making it suitable for distributed environments.

---

## Features

- **Median-Based Pivot Selection:**
  - Extracts local medians from segments of data.
  - Aggregates to decide an overall median, ensuring efficient partitioning.

- **Optimized Parallel Quicksort:**
  - Data Decomposition: Distributes data evenly across processes.
  - Reduced Communication Overhead: Uses MPI functionalities to minimize inter-process communication.
  - Dynamic Process Segregation: Segregates processes based on their relative data values to efficiently tackle data chunks.

## Installation and Usage

*Requirements:* MPI installed

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/[YourUserName]/QuantumLeapQS.git

# Navigate into the directory
cd QuantumLeapQS

# Compile the main file
mpicc -o mpi_qs main.c

# Run the program with desired number of processes and parameters
mpirun -np [Number of Processes] ./mpi_qs [Total Number of Integers] [Output File Name]
```


## Performance Insights

The project utilizes the median of medians strategy for pivot selection, resulting in more balanced partitions and efficient sorting. The time metrics showcase the speed-up gained from this parallel approach.
